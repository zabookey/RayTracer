My image shows a mixture of spheres and triangles. The middle square shows
both a textured and non textured flat shaded triangles. The outside squares
show the same things but what happens if you apply smooth shading with given
vector norms. The set of textured balls shows textures being applied to spheres
as well as demonstrating that shadows are cast upon triangles. The inner set
of solid colored spheres are there to show that shadows still work from spheres
and the bottom most sphere shows that triangles also cast shadows.
