The image "Masterpiece.ppm" provided demonstrates all aspects of the newest features of the
ray tracer. The largest sphere demonstrates reflections on a sphere while the the smaller spheres
all demonstrate transparency and refraction. The leftmost smaller sphere demonstrates what happens 
when the index of refraction is < 1 and the one on the right demonstrates what happens when the 
index of refraction is > 1. The base of the image consists of two textured triangles and demonstrates 
reflection on a flat surface. Finally the green triangle on the left edge of the image demonstrates
refraction through a flat surface.
