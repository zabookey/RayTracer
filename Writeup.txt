My image shows 10 spheres with nine of them lined up in a 3x3 square with a 
smaller sphere hovering over the top and casting a shadow from a positional
light close to it. There is another directional light coming from the same
direction as the viewing direction. The smaller sphere hovering over the top
demonstrates how increasing the power value will shrink the white reflective
circle caused by the specular term. The bottom right sphere demonstrates what
happens when you change the specular color on the sphere.
